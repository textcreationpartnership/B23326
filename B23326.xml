            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SIR, If divers occasions had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, you had sooner seen this short accompt of your Book: which yet, I think, will be large enough to let you see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than your Authors did intend: whose design, if it were the same with other Writers of <hi>pious Fables,</hi> to set out their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in whatsoever he saith or doth, as holy and heroick; I deny not but they have done their part: But if they intend it, or you take it for an <hi>History,</hi> I must first desire to be satisfied in some few scruples, before I can allow it to be such.</p>
            <p>And first, The time of his Birth, though there seems to be some mistake in it, is not a matter of such moment, as that I should have looked after it, if it had not met me in another search: Your Author places it in 1600. But <hi>E. S.</hi> when he was admitted<note place="margin">Page 1.</note>
               <hi>Scholar</hi> of <hi>C. C. C. Octob.</hi> 4. 1615. affirmed that he was not <hi>fourteen</hi> years old till the 20. of that Month; and therefore was not sworn till the 10. of <hi>November</hi> following: At
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205502:3"/> which time he took this usual <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he would inviolably keep all the College Statutes, according to the plain and litteral sense and meaning, as far as concerned himself; and as far as in him lay, cause them to be kept by others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he would not admit, obey, or use any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, injunctions, changes, or expositions contrary thereunto; but oppose and hinder them by what means he could.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he would not enter into any conspiracy or agreement against the Statutes or the State of the College, or against the President, Vice-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,</hi>
               <note place="margin">â</note>
               <hi>or any Fellow or Schollar thereof; or permit others to do so, as far as in him lay; or yield any assent, assistance, or advice to any such, either in publick or in private.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That he would not procure any dispensation of whatsoever kind, or name, or authority, against this Oath, or the Statutes, or any clause in either of them, directly or indirectly; or consent</hi>
               <note place="margin">â</note>
               <hi>to, or use any such, though procured without his knowledge or desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet two years after, when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Probationer, Mar.</hi> 22. 1616. 17. he affirmed that he was <hi>sixteen</hi> the 20. of <hi>Octob.</hi> before. But when your Author ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> this early advancement <hi>before 18. of his Seniors,</hi> to his <hi>plying his Study,</hi> and the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205502:3"/> gotten</hi> by it, his following Parenthesis confutes himself, acknowledging it due to his Country, not to his deserts: Which therefore <hi>J. M.</hi> mentions more warily, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> his mistake? For both of them must know it to be such, if they be the men whom those Letters suggest to most I meet with.</p>
            <p>At this time, as also after another two years, when he was admitted actual <hi>Fellow,</hi> he took the same Oath in each of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: And together with these, he must as oft have taken the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which he repeted likewise at his admittance to the several Degrees of <hi>Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> of Arts, together with <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> to the Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship established in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> as also at his several <hi>Ordinations</hi> (which your Authors silently pass by with the Oath of <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> at his Institutions:) And lastly, when he took the Degree of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> which your Author introduces with such a Story, as it seems by the Marginal note, he would have especially remarked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the year 1635. it pleased the Authority</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205502:4"/> words we find this note [<hi>for three years and a half.</hi>] Which if it have any fantastick refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (to say no worse) to the <hi>three days and half</hi> mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 9, 11. so as to end his reckoning with the beginning of the <hi>Long</hi> Parliament; sure your Author will be found little better at interpreting Prophecies, than he is in telling Stories. For that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> (besides that it was but a renewing of a former of King <hi>James</hi> dated <hi>May</hi> 24. 1618.) was published <hi>Octob.</hi> 18. (not 1635. but) 1633. being the <hi>ninth</hi> of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and so, <hi>five</hi> whole years before the Long Parliament began, <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1640. And <hi>E. S.</hi> took the Degree of <hi>Doctor</hi> (what? on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to spoil this pretty parallel?) at the <hi>Act</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1634. which your Author saith was <hi>during his suspension.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now for his performance there, no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary matter will serve the turn; for that might well have been allowed him, when he had such a friend at his back, as the then Professor is known to have been to the men of his Metal. But if he had such <hi>wonderful</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 14.</note>
               <hi>applause</hi> in both, why did your Author change the course, and make him an <hi>Opponent</hi> in the<note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note>
               <hi>Vespers?</hi> was it to make it a little probable, that <hi>E. S.</hi> might then <hi>non plus Doctor</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body? for then it was, <hi>Jul.</hi> 12. that <hi>E. S.</hi> held this question negatively.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:205502:4"/>
            <q>An Deus Author peccati ex Reformatorum placitis statuatur?</q>
            <p>Shewing himself such an <hi>Herculean Champion</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 64.</note> for <hi>Calvin,</hi> as made his adversaries <hi>fingers Itch,</hi> and his good friends <hi>hiss,</hi> to which your<note place="margin">P. 14. 15.</note> Author unluckily subjoyns, that <hi>one call'd out for a Candle that the Doctor</hi> (somebody) <hi>might see his arguments;</hi> for what need the <hi>Doctor look</hi> for <hi>arguments,</hi> if <hi>E. S.</hi> were the <hi>Opponent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>in Comitiis</hi> on Munday following, <hi>Jul.</hi> 14. there was another Question dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherein this new Champion was more concerned in his own behalf to have shewed his skill, if it were so <hi>wonderful</hi> as your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would perswade us:</p>
            <q>An Sanctificationi Diei Dominicae repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quae siunt corporis recreandi gratia?</q>
            <p>This being held Negatively by the Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,<note place="margin">T. L.</note> who, I think, is yet living, and <hi>E. S.</hi> being then one of the Opponents, it is a <hi>wonder,</hi> that when this darling Doctrine lay at stake, he would not venture one of his <hi>Herculean</hi> arguments to bring it fairly off, and justifie his own direct disobedience to <hi>the Authority of the Nation,</hi> both Civil and<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> Ecclesiastical, to both which, beside other Bonds, he was obliged by solemn Oath.</p>
            <p>For, is not obedience to Superiors simply necessary, unless in this one case, when they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205502:5"/> command something that is simply contrary to the Law of God? And is not the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing of a Solemn Oath in any other case a solemn Perjury? Now let them instance in any particular of that <hi>Declaration,</hi> which is as plain a breach of the <hi>Fourth</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as his Disobedience was of the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing this observation of the <hi>Lords day</hi> to be a consequent from the <hi>fourth</hi> Commandment; yet how cometh it to be<note place="margin">Pag. 26. 29, 32.</note> such a special <hi>Evidence for Heaven</hi> above all the the other <hi>Nine?</hi> for we find none of them worth mentioning among these <hi>Evidences:</hi> Or what ground is there for that pretty <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> that it <hi>is one of the first things a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 42.</note>
               <hi>porson makes Conscience of?</hi> In all the New Testament (which I thought had been the Standard for such <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi>) there is not one word of Command, no nor of Commendation of it; but many reproofs of that <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Hypocrisie, that sets up this pretense of strictness in <hi>Sanctifying</hi> the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> against the common offices of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and humanity.</p>
            <p>VVhat follows of <hi>the Assembly of Divines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> and the part of <hi>E. S. amongst them,</hi> is but a further instance of his large Conscience in point of <hi>Obedience</hi> and of <hi>Oaths:</hi> For this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205502:5"/>
               <hi>Assembly,</hi> (as also their <hi>Covenant,</hi> and their <hi>Directory,</hi> both passed over in wary silence by your Author) being expresly <hi>forbidden</hi> by the King, it lies at the door of <hi>E. S.</hi> and his friends, to shew some <hi>Command</hi> of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contrary to the Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Year 1648. there were Visitors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>

            <p>Your Author may reply, that these are no fit Yoke-fellows for <hi>E. S.</hi> who was no Actor in those bloodier parts of the Tragedy. Be it so, (though some will say, he was a Complier with those Actors, and fitter company for <hi>Peters,</hi> than for <hi>Paul,</hi>) I urge it no further, than to let you see, that every one is not a Saint, that leaves some or other of the Gang behind him, impudent enough to out-face Law and Justice, and by some patcht <hi>Memoires,</hi> to dress up a Malefactor in the disguise of a Martyr. This may serve the turn with their own party, prepared to believe, that all is gold which they say gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: But surely, the rest <hi>of the World,</hi> and<note place="margin">Epis.

            <p>The mention of these things may sound a little harsh to you, that know these men but by their own relation, for herein lies their only strength and policy, (borrowed from their elder Brethren of the <hi>Romish Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>) to possess their Proselites with some prejudice against whatever Book, Discourse, or Person, that may discover their <hi>hypocrisie.</hi>

            <p>With private matters I meddle not, much less with hearsays, or surmises, which are easily raised, or amplified, and hardly disproved: These few things I insist on, are so publick, that by an easy inquiry you may satisfie your self of the truth, or convince me of the falshood.
